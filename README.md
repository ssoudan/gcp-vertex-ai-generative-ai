## Overview

This is a Rust library to interact with the [Google Cloud Vertex AI Generative AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/overview) API.
The service and the API are in beta. The implementation is ... very beta too. Let's see how it goes.

For now only *Generative Language* is there. See [language/](language/).  

For the API key, follow what is said on https://makersuite.google.com/app/home to get one.

## Usage

At this point, see the tests in [language/src/lib.rs](language/src/lib.rs) as well as [examples/](examples/) for examples.
